# NintendAI

This is an implementation of Reinforcement Learning on Super Mario Bros. A Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) was used from [This wonderful blog post here](https://blog.paperspace.com/building-double-deep-q-network-super-mario-bros/); however, we have made some edits to the code. Mainly, comments and quality of life updates.
